        <p>This tool is dedicated to the analysis of a set of
        existential rules. It can check if this set belongs to a known
        decidable class of rules, either directly or by means of its
        Graph of Rule Dependencies (GRD). Kiabora analyzes the
        properties of the strongly connected components in the GRD,
        which allows to determine properties of the rule set with
        respect to decidability as well as the kind of paradigm
        (forward or backward chaining) ensuring decidability.</p>
