Rule Analyser TODO List
=======================

This package needs a heavy refactoring.
Don't worry: I'll take care of it whenever I have some spare time.

* RuleProperty should only impose a single method

* RuleAnalyser is a mess

* The rule hierarchy is not correctly handled (because of the use of
the rule classes provided as static instances, instead of the ones
provided in the initial collection)

* The output is buggy (see corresponding issue)

* aGRD property will probably not work as intended

* And we still need to implement a servlet (and get rid of the old
kiabora)
